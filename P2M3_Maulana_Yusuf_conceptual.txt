1. Explain what is meant by NoSQL using the understanding that you know!
Answer: Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases do not employ relational table structures. 
Flexible data types, including documents, key-value, graphs, and wide-columns, are supported by NoSQL.
Large-scale, adaptable, and quick, NoSQL is ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.

2. Explain when to use NoSQL and Relational Database Management System!
Answer:
NoSQL:
- More suitable when dealing with data that does not have a fixed schema.
- Ideal for use in large-scale and real-time applications due to high performance and support horizontal scalability.
- Less suitable for complex transaction needs or relationships between tables.

RDMS:
- Very appropriate when handling structured and consistent data
- Suitable when there are complex relationships between data and when support is needed for strong SQL 

3. Mention examples of 2 NoSQL tools/platforms other than ElasticSearch along with the advantages of the tools/platforms!
Answer:
1. MongoDB: a NoSQL document-oriented database that uses the JSON-like (BSON) format to store data.
For managing semi-structured data, such as user log data, dynamic forms, or data from online and mobile applications with often changing formats,
this database is ideal.

2. Redis: NoSQL databases of the Key-Value Store type operate in-memory, which means that all data is kept and retrieved straight from RAM rather than the disk.
Redis is regarded as one of the quickest databases because of this, making it perfect for applications requiring high speed, like real-time analytics,
session management, message queues, caching, and game leaderboards.

4. Explain what you know from Airflow using your own understanding and language!
Answer: One tool for overseeing data automation processes is Apache Airflow.
With Airflow, we can use DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to design scheduled processes like extract-transform-load (ETL), model training, data validation, etc.
Airflow is capable of managing task dependencies, scheduling, and monitoring.

5. Explain what you know from Great Expectations using your own understanding and language!
Answer: A Python package called Great Expectations is used for automatic data validation.
It helps guarantee that data entering the system satisfies quality criteria, such as appropriate ranges, matching data types, and no nulls.

6. Explain what you know from Batch Processing using your own understanding and language (Definition, Use Case Examples, Tools, etc.)!
Answer: Batch processing is a technique for processing huge amounts of data on a regular basis.
Data is first gathered, and at a specific moment, it is all analyzed at once.

Example case: Cleaning and loading daily data into the warehouse and payroll process at the end of each month.
Tools: Apache Airflow
